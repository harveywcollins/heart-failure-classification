# heart-failure-classification

This repository contains the code for predicting fatal myocardial infarctions (heart failure mortality) using various machine learning and deep learning models in R. The analysis explores data preprocessing, model fitting, hyperparameter tuning, performance assessment (via cross-validation and test sets), and calibration/threshold tuning to optimise sensiticity in a clinical context.
